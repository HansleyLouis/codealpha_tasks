# CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship Project

This project was completed as part of the 1-month internship offered by [Code Alpha](https://www.codealpha.tech/).
The goal was to analyze and visualize real-world population data using Python.

## ✅ Project Focus
- Dataset: World Population by Countries (2024–2025)
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

## 📊 Tasks Completed

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned columns: `Population (2024)`, `Fert. Rate`, `Urban Pop %`
- Analyzed:
  - Top 10 most populous countries
  - Countries with the highest fertility rates
  - Countries with the highest urban population %

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- 📉 **Bar Chart** – Top 10 most populous countries
- 🥧 **Pie Chart** – Top 5 countries + Rest of the world by population share
- 🔥 **Heatmap** – Correlation between population metrics

## 🔍 Key Insights
- India and China together account for over one-third of the world’s population.
- Countries with a lower median age tend to have higher fertility rates.
- Fertility rate and median age show a strong negative correlation (-0.85).

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to clean and analyze real-world datasets using Pandas
- How to create compelling visuals with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- How to summarize insights in a simple and clear way
